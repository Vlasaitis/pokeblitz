# AW Java Bootcamp Final Project : PokeBlitz
PokeBlitz is a web-based pokemon battle simulator game. It utilizes the PokemonAPI along with a wrapper library in order to gather pokemon-related assets (sprites, stats). The player can create an account, open a starting pack and start battling other players on the ladder. Wins and losses move a player up and down  a ladder and level up the user's pokemon, enhancing their stats. The game flow is fully simulated (based on pokemon stats, types and slight RNG elements) and logged for the player to follow the action in a battle screen.
